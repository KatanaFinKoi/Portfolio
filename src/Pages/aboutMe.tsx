            <p>
            A dedicated student at a software development bootcamp, with a diverse background in childcare, reception, retail, 
            newspaper delivery, customer service, and IT internships. This range of roles has fostered adaptability, problem-solving, 
            and strong communication skills—all essential traits for a successful computer programmer. Additionally, exposure to 
            business management at the college level during high school provides a unique understanding of project coordination and 
            organizational strategies. Volunteering at organizations like the Humane Society of Utah, Sunrise Assisted Living, and 
            various food pantries and homeless shelters has reinforced a sense of teamwork and responsibility, all of which contribute to 
            a well-rounded approach to software development.
